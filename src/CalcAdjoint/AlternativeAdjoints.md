# The Adjoint equation
We calculate w as: 
$$ w = u_f - u_g $$

$u_f$ being the solution using the dirichlet boundary conditions
$u_g$ being the solution using the neumann boundary conditions

We can come up with several possible minimization functionals:
## Using the only the boundary
### Using L^2 Norm
